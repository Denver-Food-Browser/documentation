1/28/25 | New tech team
====
- Held an info and interest session on 1/26/26 to address the technology needs of this project now that it must be migrated or rebuilt outside of Notion. I am pleased to share that **the tech team consists of 6 individuals** with varying skillsets. Team members are doing research and setting up a structure for collaborative work to keep our activities organized and effective. **It is not to late to join!**
- Removed almost all services from the prototype database as it was causing major performance issues on Notion pages linked the project. Clear your cache if you are having problems accessing the prototype
    
1/24/26 | Housekeeping
====    
- Added synced navigation to all pages for consistency and thoroughness.
- Major updates to the [Technical Design Document](https://www.notion.so/Technical-Design-Document-2a7bf4cc7f3a80e3854ae83f119028e2?pvs=21) in preparation for Monday’s info meeting.
    
1/19/26 | Info meeting for tech migration
====    
- Scheduled a meeting for 1/26/26 with local folks who are interested in learning more about the project’s tech needs and possibly helping with the migration out of Notion.

> I am hosting an info session for folks to learn more about the design and technology needs of the grassroots Food Browser project. I invite all who may be interested in volunteering on databases, UI, servers, scripting, and more to attend or reach out. Attendees are not required to make any commitments to the project
> > WHEN: Monday 1/26 5:30pm
> > WHERE: Sheridan Library room 3, 3425 W Oxford Ave
> > WHO: tech people
> > BRING: paper/laptop, face mask
> The Food Browser may be the first regional directory created using direct feedback from people who want to find free food and meals in the Denver Metro area. If it is not, tell me! View the prototype and technical design document (link deprecated)
        
1/12/26 | Planning for tech migration
====
- Added the project mission and objectives to the Landing Page.
- Contacted Vivery, the company that provides technical back- and front-end services to organizations like Food Bank of the Rockies to create their food bank directories.
    
> Hi there! This message is about a possible collaboration or support. I am a regular user of food pantries and other free food resources in Denver. Due to lack of user-focused features in existing free food databases, I maintained a personal list for 5 years and in October 2025 started collecting feedback from other food pantry users about what they would like to see in a free food directory. I created a prototype in Notion (link deprecated) but the project needs a different tech stack to handle speed and scalability.
> 1. Is it possible to apply Vivery's technology service to this grassroots directory project?
> 2. Is Vivery interested in adding user-focused features to its existing database tool?
> 3. I have an itemized list of specifically requested features which essentially fall under robust options for filtering, sorting, and searching services and service providers; or up-to-date user-to-user service verification. These features are set up in the Notion prototype. Key project objectives are also included at the included URL. I have no ego in this project and simply want a usable, accessible free food finder for all to use.
> 4. I very much look forward to your response. Thank you for your time and consideration. Rose Does (they/them/their)
        
1/1/26 | Data review (body doubling)
====
- Hosted body doubling events on 12/25/25 and 1/1/26 to support the data review: 106 services were reviewed online via these events with 17 being added that were not already on our list 🎉 There are 65 services remaining in the “to verify online” list.
- Did not add the newly verified services to the Browser/Verification Tracker because Notion is already very slow to load. Thought we would be able to upload more data before needing to switch out of Notion, but migration has supplanted data review as top priority.
    
12/21/25 | Data review
====
- Added 24 service listings to the directory & [Verification Tracker](https://www.notion.so/Verification-Tracker-2b8bf4cc7f3a801ba993ee88684ba923?pvs=21) for live verification.
- Scheduled two community body doubling events to support the data review. There are over 150 service listings to verify online.
    
12/13/25 | By Us, For Us Food Browser update
====
The **user interface** is revealed! 🎉 though the database is practically **empty**. The initial data collection process is tedious and time-consuming: we are collecting this data one-by-one for over 200 initial meals and food banks. I've yet to locate a comprehensive, datemarked list so we're making our own.

The current interface is made up of two public-facing parts: the **Food Browser** and the **Verification Tracker**.
One of the core capabilities and most requested features of this directory must be a **verification and auditing** system for maintaining service data over time. At first this will rely on **local volunteer** effort. If the directory proves useful and effective, verifications will be encouraged by any and all service goers.
    
This is the current pipeline for service listings:
1. Service information is added from websites, recent fliers, word of mouth, etc. (online verificaton)
2. Service is listed in the public-facing Verification tracker.
3. Community members visit a listed service location during listed service hours and submit an online Verification form about their experience. (live verification)
4. Services are re-added to the Verification tracker whenever their listings grow stale (no updates or verifications within a to-be-determined time period).
